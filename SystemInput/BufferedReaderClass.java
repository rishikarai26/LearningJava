        // Outputs explanation: In Scanner class if we call nextLine() method after any one of the seven nextXXX() method then the nextLine() does not read values from console and cursor will not come into console it will skip that step. The nextXXX() methods are nextInt(), nextFloat(), nextByte(), nextShort(), nextDouble(), nextLong(), next().
        // In BufferReader class there is no such type of problem. This problem occurs only for the Scanner class, due to nextXXX() methods ignoring newline character and nextLine() only reads till the first newline character. If we use one more call of nextLine() method between nextXXX() and nextLine(), then this problem will not occur because nextLine() will consume the newline character.
